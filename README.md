### Hi!
When it comes to technology, I'm really interested in:
- 📡 communications and satellites
- 🔊 audio processing and synthesizers
- 📺 broadcast engineering, video processing and   
  analog video synthesis
- 💿 obsolete media and the cultures surrounding it
- 📖 documentation, tutoring and helping others

... and learning more about it :-)

     "Today we are witness to the dawn of a new communications era
brought upon us by satellites, lasers, fiber optics, micro-processors and
   magnetic bubbles for the transfer of information, ideas, knowledge."
